    "snippet": "A newly discovered campaign dubbed GreedyBear  has leveraged over 150 malicious extensions to the Firefox marketplace that are designed to impersonate popular cryptocurrency wallets and steal more than $1 million in digital assets.  The published browser add-ons masquerade as MetaMask, TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet, among others, Koi Security researcher Tuval Admoni said.  What makes the activity notable is the threat actor's use of a technique that the cybersecurity company called Extension Hollowing to bypass safeguards put in place by Mozilla and exploit user trust. It's worth noting that some aspects of the campaign were first documented  by security researcher Lukasz Olejnik last week.  \"Rather than trying to sneak malicious extensions past initial reviews, they build legitimate-seeming extension portfolios first, then weaponize them later when nobody's watching,\" Admoni said  in a report published Thursday.  To achieve this, the attackers first create ...",

From machine learning models to production microservices, chances are your code\u2014and your business\u2014depends on Python packages you didn't write.  But in 2025, that trust comes with a serious risk.  Every few weeks, we're seeing fresh headlines about malicious packages uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI)\u2014many going undetected until after they've caused real harm. One of the most dangerous recent examples? In December 2024, attackers quietly compromised the Ultralytics YOLO package, widely used in computer vision applications. It was downloaded thousands of times before anyone noticed.  This wasn't an isolated event. This is the new normal.   Python supply chain attacks are rising fast\u2014and your next pip install could be the weakest link.
